## About the show

This wiki was created by the audience of the [Self-Hosted podcast](https://selfhosted.show). It's open to all to contribute via pull request.

The show is your gateway to self-hosting all the things. Discover new software to take control of cloud services and own your data. Learn how you can take steps to free yourself from the agenda of large corporates and business models designed to sell your information. We help you unlock the power of Linux and Open Source.
